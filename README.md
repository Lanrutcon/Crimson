WoW AddOn - Cross-Faction Whisper

**Crimson** lets you whisper other players from the opposite faction. It works by sending AddonMessages which aren't modified, so the player that receives it will be able to understand your message.

###How to use it:
---

To send a message to a player: **/crs playerName@message**

Both players (i.e. the sender and the receiver) must have the addOn in order to send/receive messages.

You can keybind the last person you send a message to, i.e. it will automatically put: **/crs lastPlayer@** - then you just need to write the message.
